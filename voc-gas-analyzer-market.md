<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Gas Analyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC gas analyzer market can be categorized into two primary types: Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductors (MOS). PID analyzers utilize ultraviolet light to ionize organic compounds, providing real-time detection of various volatile organic compounds. In contrast, MOS sensors operate by detecting changes in conductivity when VOCs interact with a heated metal oxide surface, offering cost-effective solutions for detecting lower concentrations. Both technologies serve critical roles in environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and indoor air quality assessment.</p></p>
